# Ernest UI test plan

This plan exercises the stdin/console interface of
`src/main/java/ernest/Ernest.java`.

## Execution information

- Runtime and compiler: Java 25 (`java` and `javac`).
- Main class: `ernest.Ernest`.
- The test runner compiles all sources under `src/main/java` into a temporary
  directory before testing.
- Each test case runs in a fresh process and temporary working directory. Input
  lines are sent in order, one command per line, and `bye` ends the session.
- Each successful add, delete, mark, unmark, or clear command writes the
  current task list to `data/ernest.txt` as CSV. Ernest loads this file when it
  starts.
- A test case may include an optional `Initial data` CSV block. The runner
  writes it to `data/ernest.txt` before starting that case.
- A test case may include an optional `Expected saved data` CSV block. The
  runner compares it with `data/ernest.txt` after that case completes.
- A test case may include `Data directory is a file:` to create a file named
  `data`, which simulates a storage-directory creation failure.
- A test case may include `Data file is a directory:` to create a directory at
  `data/ernest.txt`, which simulates a storage-file read failure.
- Output is compared exactly after CRLF/CR line endings are normalized to LF.
  Extra output, missing output, ordering changes, and whitespace changes fail
  the case.
- The runner prints the console input and output for each case. It stops after
  the first failure and prints both the expected and actual output.

## Test case: Exit from welcome screen

Aim: Verify that Ernest displays its welcome screen and exits cleanly when the user enters `bye`.

Inputs:
```text
bye
```

Expected output:
```text
